TODO for Sunday:


1. Download a file from another user - prerequisite is that we set up udp holepunching correctly/relay file thru supernode if holepunching doesn't work
2. Relay messages - Peter updated Protocol
3. Handle entire DHT requests (also requires hole punching or relaying)

Stretch goals:

- 9. Think about scalability (maybe compare it to Kazaa)
- our own extension (failsafe method which uses both UDP and relaying if UDP hole punching doesn't work)
