**Welcome to the README of our P2P Network!**

I reccomend reading in this order:

Start with [Structure.md](https://gitlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/hyperistic/cosc-60-final-project/blob/master/Structure.md) to get a good idea of the structure of our
network and the responsibilities of supernodes and child nodes.

Afterwards, read [Protocol.md](https://gitlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/hyperistic/cosc-60-final-project/blob/master/Protocol.md) to understand what kind of messages our network uses to communicate.
This document also gets into some specifics, offering proposed byte values for the corresponding, more general fields.

Apologies for any typos.
