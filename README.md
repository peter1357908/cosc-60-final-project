**Welcome to the README of our P2P Network!**

We reccomend reading in this order:

Start with [Structure.md](./doc/Structure.md) to get a good idea of the structure of our
network and the responsibilities of supernodes and childnodes.

Afterwards, read [Protocol.md](./doc/Protocol.md) to understand what kind of messages our network uses to communicate.
[Protocol.md](./doc/Protocol.md) also contains specific information on how to implement a peer client for this P2P Network.
